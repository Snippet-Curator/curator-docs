Notes can be edited in one of four ways:

- Keyboard shortcuts
- Right click
- Via top bar
- Via bulk edit

## Keyboard shortcuts

- Use `e` to bring up note editing menu
- Use `t` key to bring up tag menu
- Use `n` to bring up notebook menu
- Use `b` to activate or deactivate bulk edit
- Use `shift + a` keys to archive selected note(s)
- Use `del` key to delete selected note(s)

## Right Click

Right click on any notes while viewing a notebook or tag page to reveal the edit menu:

An example of edit dialog. The available items you can edit are title, description, sources, and thumbnail:

## Top Bar

The top bar is available anytime viewing a note on its own:

![](/images/note-bar.png)

From left to right:

- edit tag
- edit notebook
- rating
- edit note: title, description, thumbnails
- archive
- trash
- note info

## Add Content

At the bottom of every note is an "Add to Note" button:

![](/images/add-to-note.png)

You can use this to append content, including copied images, to the note:

![](/images/edit-note-toolbar.png)

While editing the note content directly would be nice, I found that this was very difficult without messing up the style. Most of available editors will strip existing styles when editing. For now, it's easiest to treat the saved content as non-editable and append new ones.

## Bulk Edits

Bulk edits can be helpful to make edits to multiple notes at the same time. Click the bulk button (shortcut `b`) to activate:

Click to selecte note(s):

Different options after selection:

### Bulk Merge

Notes are merged in the order they are selected. The first note selected is used as the new title and notebook. Tags, content, and sources are merged. If the first note has no thumbnail, and another note does, thumbnail from the other note is sued.
