You can organize notes using both notebooks and tags. Alternatively, spend less time organizing and just use Discover and Search instead.

## Notebooks and Tags

Notes can only be in one notebook but can have multiple tags.

Emojis are supported! Right click on a notebook or tag to make edits:

Notebooks and tags can also be nested. Mix and match to create better organization. Example of using who, when, where, what for tags:

## Pin

You can pin and unpin notebooks and tags for easy access.
