Curator is an open source, personal, private, and offline app that you can use to import and re-discover internet clips over time.

Instead of links to webpages, items imported to Curator are saved and viewable offline. Even if the original webpage is deleted or you lose internet connection, your saves are still secure on your computer.

My biggest reason to make Curator is to discover old saves. Just add items and forget about them. Saves are presented on Discover page one at a time based on their rating, votes, and how recently they were seen.

I made Curator for myself, as my personal alternative to Evernote and Anki.
